For this article you should focus on the findings reported for Experiment 1 in section 2.2. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> The first step in our analyses was to average six key measurements across all participants: Letter Recall Accuracy, Letter Recall Accuracy by Cue Type (whether observers were asked about the color diversity of cued or uncued rows), Color Diversity Accuracy, Color Diversity Accuracy by Cue Type (cued or uncued rows), Color Diversity Accuracy by Diversity Type (high or low), and Color Diversity Accuracy by Cue Type and Diversity Type (interaction). These measurements are included in Table 1, along with the relevant statistics that highlight significant performance. In general, letter recall accuracy was well above chance (11.11%), and (as depicted in Fig. 3A) observers were also able to correctly report color diversity above chance (50.00%).
